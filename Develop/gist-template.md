# Regular expression Tutorial

## Description

A regular expression in short known as regex, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern.
A pattern consists of one or more character literals, operators, or constructs. Regular expressions is used to find
patterns of characters within a string, find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string and validation of user input. 


## Summary

Regular expressions basically allow us to search for specific pattens of text and they can look extremely complicated. You can create a regular expression just for a search pattern within a text or can be used to find usernames, emails, hex values, URLs, or HTML tags.
Regex are widely used in all popular languages like, Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP etc.
For validating an email address, we can use below expression.

/^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/

This is a search pattern meant for basic Email validation. It is wrapped in forward slashes (/) at th beginning and end of the expression. Within those forward slashes, you will find the components of a regex: anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, OR operators, flags, and character escapes.
